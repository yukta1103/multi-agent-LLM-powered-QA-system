"""The different kinds of actions that AndroidEnv supports.

The native action space of AndroidEnv consists of a tuple consisting of
- A position (x, y) âˆˆ [0, 1] x [0, 1], determining the location of the action on
  the screen, and
- A discrete value, indicating the action type, which is in this file.

See https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.13231, section 2.2 for details.
