# Dynamic Replanning Executor Agent

## Overview

This project implements a simple **Executor Agent** that executes plans in a simulated Android environment (`MockAndroidEnv`). The agent can dynamically **replan** if a step fails, using a basic `PlannerAgent`. A `VerifierAgent` checks if the goals were achieved successfully.

---

## Features

- Simulated Android environment with basic Wi-Fi toggling actions
- Planner that generates plans based on goal and current environment state
- Executor that executes plans step-by-step, triggers replanning on failures
- Verifier that confirms if goals were achieved based on UI state
- Prevention of infinite replanning loops

---
